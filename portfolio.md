# I'm looking for you!
Unfortunately at the moment none of the existing investment options are ideal. I feel the risks are too high or the returns are too low. In the future I plan on putting a higher percentage of my bitcoin portfolio to work as I discover more attractive investments.

Signup below and I'll let you know when there are attractive investment options.

### Other holdings:
* Ethereum

### Investments I plan on Exploring:

* [First Global Credit](http://firstglobalcredit.com/) - Allows customers to get exposure to stock equities using bitcoin as collateral.
* Buying BitcoinShop stock (ticker [BTCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=btcs)) through [OptionsHouse](http://oh.tellapal.com/a/clk/22Dppg)
* More [Arbitrage](/how-to-earn-bitcoins-through-arbitrage.html) - I'd love to put my arbitrage bot back to work.

### Investments I'm Avoiding:

* [Bitfinex Swaps](/bitfinex-pays-bitcoin-interest.html) - UI was confusing and I don't think I was earning.
* Cloud Mining Contracts - ROI seems dubious and I've heard rumors some are ponzi schemes.
* Mining - ROI has always seemed dubious to me. I've heard some players get government subsidies and some players get cheap electricity. I have no advantages in that game and I avoid it.
* Shorting Bitcoins - Bitcoin is the most exciting tech I've seen since the Internet. I wouldn't want to be short bitcoin ever. For those who do want to short, or go long even I recommend [Btc.sx](https://btc.sx/). Btc.sx allows traders to go long or short bitcoin using bitcoin.
