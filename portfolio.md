Unfortunately at the moment I'm not excited about any of the available investment options. I feel the risks are too high and the returns are too low. In the future I plan on putting a higher percentage of my portfolio to work as I discover more attractive investments.

### My portfolio holdings as of 11/7/2014.

| Service       | Annual APR    | Bitcoins |
| ------------- |-------------: | -----:   |
| BTC Delta     |            5% |     8    |
| BTC Jam       |           30% |    1.5   |
| Total         |            NA |   250    |

### Other holdings:

* Ethereum

### Investments I plan on Exploring:

* [First Global Credit](http://firstglobalcredit.com/) - Allows customers to get exposure to stock equities using bitcoin as collateral.
* Buying BitcoinShop stock (ticker [BTCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=btcs)) through [OptionsHouse](http://oh.tellapal.com/a/clk/22Dppg)

### Investments I'm Avoiding:

* Bitfinex Swaps - UI was confusing and I don't think I was earning.
* Cloud Mining Contracts - ROI seems dubious and I've heard rumors some are ponzi schemes.
* Mining - ROI has always seemed dubious to me. I've heard some players get government subsidies and some players get cheap electricity. I have no advantages in that game and I avoid it.
* Shorting Bitcoins - Bitcoin is the most exciting tech I've seen since the Internet. I wouldn't want to be short bitcoin ever. For those who do want to short, or go long even I recommend [Btc.sx](https://btc.sx/). Btc.sx allows traders to go long or short bitcoin using bitcoin.
