Coin Agenda has been my favorite conference this year. It mixed education, elegance, investment opportunity, and great networking. 

Michael Terpin did a knockout job putting together a high-end conference in a short amount of time. 

# elegance 
This conference targeted high net worth individuals and institutional investors. Michael made the conference stand out in these ways:

* Great venue the palms from real world Las Vegas fame
* Kcked off with party at the Hugh Hefner suite. This two-floor suite has a large patio, pool, rotating bed, massage table, living room with 3 tvs. 
* High end breakfasts, lunches, and dinners
* Party at the Mike Tyson mansion. This mansion made famous in the movie Hangover has fountains, boxing mosaics, a pool, grotto, basketball court, budaes, tiger art, a large balcony for parties, and an all glass bathroom. 
* Closing party at michael and xxx terpins elegant home. Their home has a deck big enough to host 60 people, a pool with a swim through, fire-pits, and a 20 person sauna.
