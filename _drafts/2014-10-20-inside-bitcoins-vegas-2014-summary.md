Bulls I was excited to present at Inside Bitcoins Vegas, one of the largest largest bitcoin events worldwide!

It meant a lot for me to speak at this conference because it was at this conference last year I decided to shut down my Mobile App Development company and dive into bitcoin full time!

This conference had a markedly different level of enthusiasm from last year. Unfortunately I think that is 100% because of the downturn in bitcoin price. Last year the conference took place in early December. Over the past 60 days or so bitcoin had shot from around $100 to $1,200.

People were flooding in at the last minute to sign up and attend. Everyone's eyes were wide with excitement thinking about all the possibilities bitcoin presented.

This year there were less people, less excitement, and less optimism. Since the bitcoin industry is more mature I credit the price pullback for the drop in enthusiasm. Unfortunately I suspect some people who had registered decided not to go.

However people focused on the price as a measure of bitcoin's success are misguided. Bitcoin is absolutely more valuable than last year. This conference is a good example. There were professionals from Wedbush and Ersnt and Young for example. Patrick Byrne announced he is building a competing exchange. The Bitshares product got lots of attention. There are all kinds of derivatives, liquidity providers, and even a company that lets people buy stock with bitcoin.

None of that existed a year ago. Some of it would have been unimaginable.

In addition to hearing a lot of great sessions I got to meet cool people like:
