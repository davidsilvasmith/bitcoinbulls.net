I'll be returning to DC for the first time in almost a decade. I have a lot of great memories visiting college friends and my cousin here.

Tomorrow though I'll be here on business.

I'm happy to announce I'll be educating congressional policy makers about bitcoin as part of the Chamber of Digital Commerce's [Inaugural Congressional Bitcoin Education Day](http://www.digitalchamber.org/btc-education-day.html). I'm one of 32 bitcoin industry participants from 12 states who flew in for the discussions. 

I'm honored to be part of such an important effort.

Bitcoin is a complex topic. I'm glad I've practiced explaining it and industry issues to tens of thousands of people over the past year. I know those experiences will make tomorrow's discussions productive. Of course I've been asked a lot of tough questions over the past year and now I can't remember the last time I was asked a question I hadn't heard before. This means I have answers that everyone can understand.

It's going ot be an exciting day and I'm sure I'll have an update after the fact.

P.S. Unfortunately this means I'm missing the Michigan State Spartans Football home opener today. I've made all of the season openers since moving back to Lansing. Oh well, I guess I care more about Bitcoin than my alma mater.
