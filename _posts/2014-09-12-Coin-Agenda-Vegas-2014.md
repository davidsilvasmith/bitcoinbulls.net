Bulls I'm excited to announce I'll be presenting at [CoinAgenda](http://www.coinagenda.com), the first bitcoin investor conference in Las Vegas October 7th through the 9th.

The conference will have sessions, presentations, and exhibits for individual and institutional investors along with networking parties such as a VIP dinner at the legendary former Mike Tyson mansion made famous in the movie, The hangover. The conference will include meals and cocktail parties throughout the event.
