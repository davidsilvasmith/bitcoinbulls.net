title: HelloFuture The Ultimate Currency
excerpt: Watching Super Bowl 49 I wasn't particularly interested in the game. I was looking for bitcoin ads. When I saw the 1994 Today show clip start off an ad, my heart nearly skipped a beat! I thought I was about to see a bitcoin ad during the Super Bowl!

I was working through emails while casually watching Super Bowl 49 (crazy ending by the way). I became interested in the game because of the McDonald's tease about taking a digital currency. Wow, wouldn't it be awesome if there were something bitcoin related?

Focused on my computer I hear Bryant Gumbel's voice from a clip we bitcoiners know [all too well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg&src_vid=eAV2Gjkhztg). Wow! This is amazing! A bitcoin company bought a bitcoin super bowl ad! 

## 30 Seconds later...

I hear Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel speculating about how an electric car works.

Big ideas take getting used to? An electric car?! BmW's i3 isn't what I'd call a Newfangled Idea. Seems like more of an incremental change over the gas engines we've been using for over 100 years to me.

## It should have been bitcoin...

It should have been a bitcoin ad not an electric car! Bitcoin is the only technology as revolutionary and empowering as the Internet was.

We all thought we were going to get it and were let down.

I've stretched my amateurish editing skills past their limit (sorry for the poor audio clips), but I've succeeded in parodying the BMW i3 â€“ "Newfangled Idea" ad into what it should have been: A bitcoin ad.
