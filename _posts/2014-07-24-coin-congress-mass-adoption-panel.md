Key panel takeaways:

 - We believe bitcoin mass adoption is coming!
 - We see mass adoption coming to less developed countries first (for example Argentina)
 - Education is hindering adoption worldwide ([So What's Bitcoin helps with education](http://www.sowhatsbitcoin.com))
 - Practical use cases are hindering adoption worldwide.
 - Bitcoin infrastructure is being built out to enable practical use cases.
 - We see mass adoption coming to the U.S. through a killer app that hasn't been developed yet.

It was fun being on the panel and talking about the exciting and promising future of bitcoin!
