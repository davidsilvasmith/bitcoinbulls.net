This week my Trezor arrived.

Trezor is a bitcoin safe.

It promises to enable secure bitcoin transactions. To achieve this it is designed to do one thing, sign transactions on the device. Signing transactions on the device means the private key is never provided to the computer that created the transaction. This means the device could be used on a virus infested computer and the bitcoins would be safe.

Safety has been an issue preventing people from feeling comfortable storing large amounts of bitcoin. Today bitcoin users have to make trade offs between security and convenience. It isn't so cool to have a digital currency that is inaccessible because it is stored on a paper wallet stuffed in a bank vault or on a computer that isn't connected to the Internet.

Trezor promises to make bitcoin usage safe AND secure.

The basic idea is a single-purpose USB device that is just used to sign transactions. It is designed to always keep the private key on the device and never transmit the private key to any connected device.

When thinking about storing a substantial amount of bitcoins (think hundreds or tens of thousands) on a Trezor some concerns are raised like:

 - What happens if I lose my Trezor?
 - How can I be sure my private key isn't transmitted to my computer?
 -
