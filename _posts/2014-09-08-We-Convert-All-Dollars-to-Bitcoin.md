![Bitcoin Bulls converts dollars to bitcoins.](/images/dollarsToBitcoins.jpg "Bitcoin Bulls converts dollars to bitcoins.")

Bulls, I'm excited to announce today that my platform provider, [Benzinga](http://www.benzinga.com), has begun paying me 100% in bitcoin!

As a Bitcoin Bull I felt it was important to put my money where my mouth is. I was elated Benzinga agreed!

This means the dollars they collect via credit card payments are being converted to bitcoins and zipped over to me.

Our business to business bitcoin payment agreement is one of the first in the world!

One of the great things about bitcoin is radical transparency. Everyone can see the business-to-business bitcoin payments that have been made at this bitcoin address: [1JGRPbT7etiTNJV9DXj6oFUKMR5raSrwjT](https://blockchain.info/address/1JGRPbT7etiTNJV9DXj6oFUKMR5raSrwjT). 

Pretty cool huh?

Let me know what you think in the comments!
