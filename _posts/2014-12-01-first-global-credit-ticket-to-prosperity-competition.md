[First Global Credit](https://firstglobalcredit.com/) is holding a competition on their [Active Trader Service](http://www.firstglobalcredit.com/Services/Active-Trader) beginning December 1st. The free contest will provide the winner with 10 bitcoins to use for real trading! The profits will be [split with First Global Credit](http://www.firstglobalcredit.com/Competition/Competition-Terms). Traders have until Friday January 16th to stack virtual profits and see who comes out on top.

Bitcoin doesn't have a lot of practical use cases yet. However bitcoin is the fastest and safest way to move investment capital around today. I am excited to add First Global Credit to investment options like [BTCJam](/can-btc-jam-grow-your-bitcoins/).

The competition is live! I logged in and saw the 100 synthetic bitcoins available for to me for the competition. I don't expect to win, but who knows and I'll get a chance to better understand how the platform works.

If you do sign up with [First Global Credit](https://firstglobalcredit.com/) it would be great if you used my username **smithd98** for the referring user.

Also if you participate in the competition let me know in the comments. I hope a Bull wins!

Ladies and gentlemen start your trading engines!
