I was honored to participate in the [Inaugural Congressional Bitcoin Education Day](http://www.digitalchamber.org/btc-education-day.html).

[Perianne Boring](https://twitter.com/PerianneDC), [Margaux Avedisian](https://twitter.com/MargauxWithAnX), and Congressman [Steve Stockman](https://twitter.com/SteveWorks4You) put together a great program. They successfully educated all house members on bitcoin. [Brian Santos](https://twitter.com/BrianSantoshi) put the icing on the cake by sponsoring drinks and appetizers after the long day. 

We provided educational material to **all** 435 house members. 32 participants from 12 states traveled in for a day packed with meetings. We met with staff from 70 offices. For the other 365 house members we hand delivered the material.

I met with: 

* Nancy Ju√°rez from Steven Horsford's office (D Nevada)
* Josh Reiner from Gus Bilirakis's office (R Florida)
* Joanna Brown from representative Tim Walberg's office (R Michigan)
* Justin Talbot Zorn from John Conyers Jr.'s office (D Michigan)

If you haven't seen Capitol Hill's insides, here is a collage of me visiting the offices:

We didn't just do education. I learned a lot myself on a tour of Capitol Hill Congressman Stockman hooked us up with.

Finally we closed out the day with drinks and snacks provided by Brian Santos, CEO of [eSpend](http://www.espend.com/).

At the cocktail hour I got to speak with:

 * Congressman Steve Stockman (R Texas), who introduced the [Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4602/text)
 * Zachary Leshin, who drafted the [Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act](http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-plans-to-introduce-the-virtual-currency-tax-reform-act).
 * Howard Segermark, Senior Policy Counsel for Congressman Stockman


It was a great day!

My only regret was missing my Michigan State Spartans football home opener.
