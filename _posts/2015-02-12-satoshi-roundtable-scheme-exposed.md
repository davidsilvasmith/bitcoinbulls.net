Despite the conspiracy theorists concerns, there were no evil plans discussed. Quite the opposite actually. For those who don't know, organizer Bruce Fenton took some undeserved criticism for hosting the meeting. Coindesk called it "[a secretive, closed-door gathering of elite bitcoin CEOs and luminaries this weekend.](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-elite-meet-secret-island-bilderberg-style-retreat/)"

This was a group of about 60 people who are all dedicated to making the world a better place.

That makes sense when you consider many (but certainly not all) of the attendees hold libertarian and voluntaryist philosophies. Never heard of a voluntaryist?

>[Voluntaryists are advocates of non-political, non-violent strategies to achieve a free society.](http://voluntaryist.com/)

C'mon, does this look like a group of evildoers?

## Lucky Me

I was fortunate to attend last weekend's Satoshi Roundtable.

Bruce did a great job of putting on a high end event.
