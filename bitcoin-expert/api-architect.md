## I've used over 100 APIs.

I have used over 100 APIs. Some were a pleasure; some were a nightmare. One weather API took three days of coding to use and still didn't work well. We decided to switch to an 'unofficial' API. It took 4 hours to make the switch, improved the reliability, and improved the usability! Don't make developers hate your platform. Spend time crafting an enjoyable, upgradeable, fast platform.

## I've created over a dozen APIs.

I have created dozens of APIs. From image processing to customer relationship management, to financial applications, I have a wide-range of API experience. I craft APIs that make it easy to fall into the pit of success. I believe API consumers should have full control. Doing the right thing should be easy. Potential pitfalls should be clearly labeled so developers don't fall into the pit of failure.

I have experience designing APIs for Fortune 500 companies. I've worked on software systems for companies like Microsoft, John Deere, Michigan State University, Jackson National Life, Mazda, Audi, Nissan, and the State of Michigan.

## Your market share will thank you later :)
API's are about Building a Platform. Developers should enjoy using your API. It should be designed in an intuitive manner. This not only increases product usage but also reduces support calls.

Hire me to help 

* Design your API.
* Test your API.
* Create libraries (C#, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, etc.) for your API.
