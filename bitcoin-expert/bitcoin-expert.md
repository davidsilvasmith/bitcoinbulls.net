This is a nascent rapidly changing industry. What you read last month may be out-of-date. Speed-to-market, correctness, and risk-mitigation are important to capture the opportunities created by bitcoin. Not only can I tell you where the industry is today, I have a better idea than most as to where it is going. 

For example I predicted PayPal would use bitcoin instead of competing with it half a year before their announcement ([proof](http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/03/4409527/paypal-should-use-bitcoin-not-compete)). Six months may not seem like a long time but bitcoin changes so fast. For comparison forecasting six months out in the bitcoin industry is like forecasting 5 years out in the mobile industry.

My experience can help bitcoin businesses [build platforms](/bitcoin-expert/api-architect/), [get to market quickly](/bitcoin-expert/experienced-bitcoin-consultant/), and [increase market share](/bitcoin-expert/educator/).

I help by:

* [Designing and testing bitcoin service API's.](/bitcoin-expert/api-architect/)
* [Market research and competitive analysis for bitcoin ventures.](/bitcoin-expert/experienced-bitcoin-consultant/)
* [Explain bitcoin in plain English to executives, investors, general audiences, or software developers.](/bitcoin-expert/educator/)

## Bitcoin: The Most Empowering Force Since the Internet

Bitcoin is the most empowering force since the Internet. No other payment mechanism gives people the control, flexibility, choices, and efficiency that bitcoin provides. Sound familiar? No other communication tool gives the control, flexibility, choice, and efficiency that the Internet provides. In the next ten years bitcoin will impact every modern business just like the Internet impacted businesses over the past ten.

## Harness the Empowerment
