#Why I'm a Bitcoin Bull

Everyone deserves to be empowered.

Bitcoin is the most empowering force since the Internet. 

I'm investing in bitcoin to be a part of that change. Here is my story...

## My Story

I've been a risk averse investor most of my life. A few years low stock market returns coupled with low interest rates left me struggling with how to hit my retirement goals. Reading 4 hour work week changed my perspective.

Now I realize that not-taking risks can be riskier than taking risks. That is how I feel about bitcoin. If I don't participate and bitcoin is successful I will regret it for the rest of my life. If I do participate and bitcoin fails my life will continue on nearly unchanged.

This makes the risk of not participating lifelong regret while the risk of participating is a sustainable financial loss.

That means I have to invest in what is going to be the most empowering force since the Internet. I want to help that vision come to fruition.

### Before Bitcoin

I was a technology consultant.

I started my own company to take control of my life. I created a successful mobile consultancy. I increased the amount of time I spent with my son, increased my investment portfolio, took up cooking, and tried gardening.

### Bitcoin Changed Me Forever

No matter if bitcoin succeeds or not bitcoin has changed me forever. It has been fantastic being in this industry. I've meet fantastically interesting people, traveled to cool places, and had my eyes opened on a lot of issues.

Bitcoin is going to change the world forever. It has let a genie out of a bottle. People like me have experienced the standard of living improvements digital assets provide. We realize it is just as profound as the Internet improved communications.

### I Care About Experiences & Education

I don't care much about things. I care about experiences and education. I want to be doing new things, challenging myself, and learning.

Unlike most of my contemporaries I drive a decade-old car.
