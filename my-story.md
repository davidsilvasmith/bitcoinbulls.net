#Why I'm a Bull

Bitcoin has the potential to change the world. The industry is on track to be bigger than the Internet. I am investing in bitcoin to change my life. Here is my story...

## My Story

I was a burned out middle class American with an above average savings and below average spending habits.

### Penny Pinching for no Reason

Unlike most of my contemporaries I drive a decade-old car.

I live in a below average house.

I was penny pinching. Eating ramen, canned food, shopping at good will, buying used cars. Too save enough money to retire. But no matter how much I saved kids and taxes took so much I wouldn't be able to retire for at least a decade.

### Burned Out

My career as a technology consultant in the private sector burned me out. I realized businesses wasted a lot. More often than I'd suspected. Businesses also didn't compensate employees so much on value provided, but on seniority and pay band.

I started my own company to take control of my life. I created a successful mobile consultancy. I increased the amount of time I spent with my son, increased my investment portfolio, took up cooking, and tried gardening. Life was relaxing, but unrewarding professionally or financially.

### Bitcoin Might Change that Forever

I saw and believed in technologies like: the Internet and companies like Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, but I didn't put my capital on the line. Instead I was grueling away pinching pennies and selling my freedom to increase my retirement account.

Bitcoin is going to change the world forever. It has let the genie out of the bottle. People like me have seen the promise of digital assets to improve financial transactions just like the Internet improved communications.

If bitcoin is successful it will change my life forever. I won't need to work a job I don't like. I won't need to pinch pennies.
